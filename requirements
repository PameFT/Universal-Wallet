[1] Installing pip dependencies instructions

<Installing python libraries for windows>
This guide serves as a step by step process for setting up and validating the web3.py, bit, and hd-wallet-derive libraries used to programmatically send and receive transactions over a blockchain network via virtual wallets. Without these libraries, class activities and their associated code will not be able to perform the necessary operations.

1. Open a terminal and execute the following commands to install web3.py and bit, respectively. Windows users MUST use the Anaconda Prompt in this section.

2. Open the terminal and in the base environment, run the following code in order:
 conda update conda
 conda update anaconda

3. Run the following command to create a brand new Python virtual environment for this unit.
 conda create -n ethereum python=3.7 anaconda

4. Activate the new environment.
 conda activate ethereum

5. Use the pip install command to download and install the web3.py module.
 pip install web3

6. Use the pip install command to download and install the bit module.
 pip install bit 



[2] Installing hd-wallet-derive

1. With the latest version of PHP installed on our machines, we can now proceed to the installation of the hd-wallet-derive library.

2. Begin by opening a fresh terminal. Windows users must open their terminal as administator as follows:
 Input C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe directly into the system search bar and launch the program as Administrator from the resulting menu.

3. With your terminal open as indicated for your operating system, cd into your `Blockchain-Tools folder and run the following code:
   git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
  cd hd-wallet-derive
  curl https://getcomposer.org/installer -o installer.php
  php installer.php
  php composer.phar install

4.  You should now have a folder called hd-wallet-derive containing the PHP library!


[3] Creating a symlink called "derive" for the hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php script into the top level project folder(Blockchain-Tools folder in the below example). This will clean up the command needed to run the script in our code, as we can call ./derive instead of ./hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php.

<Steps for creating hd-wallet Symlink on Gitbash as administrator>
1	cd  ..../Blockchain-Tools/hd-wallet-derive
: This is an example file path. Go to hd-wallet-derive folder.

2	export MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestric
: Run the code above on Gitbash opened as administrator

3	cd ..
: Go back to Blockchain-Tools folder.

4	ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive
: Run the above code on Gitbash

5	./derive -g --mnemonic="YOUR MNEMONIC GOES HERE" --cols=path,address,privkey,pubkey 
: Run the above code on Gitbash to see the wallet addresses using your own 12 mnemonic phrase inside the quotes.
